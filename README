Howto install this unofficial version of ChromeIPass:
	1. Open the Chrome-Extensions tab in Chrome (Settings > Extensions)
	2. Just drag and drop my version of ChromeIPass into this tab
	3. Installation starts

To get the best matching credentials in the HTTP-Auth dialog you need to use my version of KeePassHTTP,
which is sorting the credentials by the best matching url.
You get the plugin here: https://github.com/lspcity/keepasshttp
Just download the KeePassHttp.plgx and drop it into your KeePass-Home-Directory.

PassIFox extension for Firefox4+, now on Chrome as ChromeIPass (see
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ompiailgknfdndiefoaoiligalphfdae)

ChromeIPass effectively behaves identically to PassIFox with the exception
of saving new and updated passwords, the feature has not been implemented
yet.  Where you see Firefox below, replace with Chrome.

Implements a transparent replacement for the built-in Firefox password storage

This extension is for use with https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp

The XPI can be installed using the link:
    https://passifox.appspot.com/passifox.xpi

Prereqs:
    1) KeePass
       http://keepass.info/
    2) KeePassHttp
       https://passifox.appspot.com/KeePassHttp.plgx
       https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/raw/master/KeePassHttp.plgx

Install:
    1) Copy KeePassHttp.plgx to C:\Path\To\KeePass.exe\Dir

Configuration:
    There is no explicit configuration necessary. PassIFox and KeePassHttp
    will communicate with each other on http://localhost:19455/

    When a login form is discovered for the first time, PassIFox will
    initialize itself and request an "Association" with KeePass (KeePassHttp).
    Alternatively, for forms that do not fill automatically, a context menu
    item on text and password fields allow manually filling in a login.

    Once that is completed, Firefox can freely retrieve passwords from
    KeePass. KeePass must be running and unlocked in order for passwords
    to be available.

    Entries in KeePass can be stored as http://host.name/ or just host.name
    without any extra fluff. KeePassHttp will do the work to figure out what
    you want. There are some permissions things where KeePassHttp will
    notify you when passwords are requested and the hostnames do not exactly
    match. When those prompts occur, you can accept, deny and remember your
    choice.

      For example, take the URL "http://www.google.com/" the entry in KeePass
      can be named http://www.google.com, www.google.com, or google.com
      Any will match a request for passwords, but if the entry is named
      google.com, and a request for comes from http://www.google.com you
      will be prompted to approve the request, and if you like, you can choose
      to remember the selection so that you are not prompted again.

      NOTE: Keep in mind, the field in which you put the names is the 'Title'
      field, and not 'URL'.  Use 'URL' to store a shortcut link that will take
      you to your site.  Use the 'Title' field to match sites for logins.
